The sunflower is somewhere to the left of the carnation.\n2. The guitar is in the same house as the zebra.\n3. The rose is not in the same house as the guitar.\n4. The zebra is in house 3.\n5. The trumpet is in house 4.\n6. The carnation is in the same house as the flute.\n\nGoal:\nWork out which plant is in each house (houses are numbered 1 left\u2011to\u2011right).You can think step-by-step as long as you want, but eventually you need to give your answer.Give you answer inside a \\boxed{...} tag, and format your answer as a Python list.So the answer should be like this: \\boxed{['item1', 'item2', 'item3', ...]}.",

The piano is somewhere to the right of the guitar.\n6. The fern is in house 4.\n7. The trumpet is not in the same house as the parrot.\n8. Exactly one of guitar, lily, or flute is in house 1.\n9. The guitar is in the same house as the juice.\n10. The milk is somewhere to the left of the flute.\n11. Exactly one of trumpet, dog, or juice is in house 4.\n\nGoal:\nWork out which pet is in each house (houses are numbered 1 left\u2011to\u2011right).You can think step-by-step as long as you want, but eventually you need to give your answer.Give you answer inside a \\boxed{...} tag, and format your answer as a Python list.So the answer should be like this: \\boxed{['item1', 'item2', 'item3', ...]}.",

The Aeneid is somewhere to the left of the drums.\n2. The ivy is in house 2.\n3. The water is not in house 3.\n4. The violin is in house 1.\n5. Exactly one of juice, ivy, or rose is in house 3.\n6.
